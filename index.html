Bathed city<br>
<br>
Bathed city<br>
<br>
The liquid scenery<br>
Cast an indigo complexation<br>
To drift so carefree, moonlight reflects in the pool of darker times<br>
And to sink to darker measures<br>
Submariner seeks pride from depths hard to find, forever wading<br>
A pool of strange things<br>
Its guilt, is craving, this comfort, it's quilt<br>
And outside I think it's raining<br>
<br>
Why'd you leave me? Because of my depression?<br>
You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a lesson<br>
Things are even<br>
But don't even out<br>
The deep sea diver's in doubt<br>

And if we swim down low<br>
This pressure might go beneath the covers the cotton ceiling<br>
And if we swim down low<br>
This pressure might grow beneath city lights I'm wandering home<br>
And if we swim down low<br>
The pressure might go beneath the sheets I'm covered in<br>
And if we swim down low<br>
The pressure might grow those woes were still hovering<br>
<br>
This day's slipping<br>
I feel my feet drift<br>
Tarmac city skin<br>
I walk the beat swift<br>
The sunsets, the moon lifts<br>
Those blue hours, those blue hours<br>
Those blue hours, that blue shift<br>
